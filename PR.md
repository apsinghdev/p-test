‚úèÔ∏è Frontend Task: Dynamic Input List with Optimized Rendering
Objective:

Build a small React application that allows users to manage a dynamic list of input fields. The list starts with 20 inputs and can be modified by the user.

üß© Components:
You should implement two components:

1. Parent Component
Renders a list of 20 input fields using the Child component.
Each input should have a fixed label like Input 1, Input 2, ..., Input 20.
Provide a "Print All" button that logs the values of all current inputs to the console.
Provide an "Add Input" button to append a new empty input to the list.
Each input should have a "Remove" button to delete itself from the list.
2. Child Component
Renders a single input field with a label and a remove button.

The component should only re-render when its own value changes or it is removed/re-added.

‚úÖ Additional Requirement:

When an input is removed (e.g., Input 2), that input should go away, but the labels of the remaining inputs must not shift.

For example, if Input 2 is removed, the list should show:
Input 1, (gap), Input 3, Input 4, etc. ‚Äî skipping Input 2.

When printing values in console, only the remaining input values should be printed (those that are still visible and has values).

‚úÖ Requirements Summary:

20 inputs should render on load.
Typing in one input should not cause other inputs to re-render.
Labels must stay fixed to their original index even after deletions.
